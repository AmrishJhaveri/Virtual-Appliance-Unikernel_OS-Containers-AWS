----------

## Pre-requiste ##

----------

- Ubuntu 16.04 / Linux OS
- Java v1.8
- Apache Maven v3.3.9
- Git v2.7.4
- Docker CE v18.09

## Setup  ##

----------

### Capstan ###
1. Install go package:


	wget https://golang.org/doc/install?download=go1.12.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
	

2. Untar the tar.gz into /usr/local folder	


	sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.2.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

	
3. Install qemu-kvm package.


	sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm		


4. Set the ENV variables:


	echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/go'  >>  $HOME/.profile
	
	echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin:/usr/local/go/bin' >>  $HOME/.profile
	
	source $HOME/.profile


5. Install Capstan            


        go get github.com/cloudius-systems/capstan


## Build ##

----------

### 1. Spring App (chess-rest-api.jar) ###

Chekout this repository. Run the following command from within the directory where pom.xml is present.

	mvn clean package

Test this fat jar independently by running the following command:

	java -jar target/chess-rest-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

The REST API services for the Chess App will be running at `localhost:8081/chess/newGame` (POST request)

### 2. Build the OSv Image  ###

	capstan run -f "8081:8081"-f "8000:8000"

Chess Spring App runs on port 8081
OSv Dashboard and its REST APIs are available on port 8081.

Also this will create a image( `disk.qcow2` ) in the directory `~/.capstan/instances/qemu/chess-rest-api`


## Chess REST API & JSON structure ##

----------

- Chess's white piece will be the player using the rest service.
- All white pieces will be placed from a to h (horizontally-left to right) and 1 to 8 (bottom to top). 
- Please use the following service with Postman client.
- All requests are POST requests. Request and reponse JSON are provided for each kind of request.
- Please select POST request, in the request body section select "raw" and then select type as "application/json" from the drop down.
- You can copy the sample request json and change the values accordingly.
- Spring Application is exposed on port 8081. If you change the mapping on the host port then change the url accordingly. (Assumption host port & spring container port are mapped as 8081. 

### JSON MoveObject Fields ###

1. session(String): This will contain the session Id for the game provide by the newGame service(described below).
2. start(Stirng): The start square of the piece to be moved e.g. e2.
3. end(String): A target square of the piece for the the move e.g e4. It must be a valid square else the move will not be made.
4. message(String): Used in response for providing a description based on the move made.

## Deployment on AWS  ##

### OSv Image with Spring App on EC2 ###


Step 1: Convert the disk.qcow2 image located at `~/.capstan/instances/qemu/chess-rest-api to a `raw` format image
	
	qemu-img convert disk.qcow2 chess-rest-api-img.raw

Note: This creates a 10GB image. 

Create a IAM role named `vmimport` using the `qemu-images/trust-policy.json` (change the current directory):

	aws iam create-role --role-name vmimport --assume-role-policy-document "file://trust-policy.json"

Tag role policy to this `vmimport` role using `role-policy.json` (change the current directory):
	
	aws iam put-role-policy --role-name vmimport --policy-name vmimport --policy-document "file://role-policy.json"


Step 2: Create a bucket on AWS S3 with the command:

	aws s3 mb s3://com.uic.cs441.hw4.amrish


![](https://bitbucket.org/ajhave5/amrishashvinkumar_jhaveri_hw4/raw/master/images/aws_osv_step2.png)


Step 3: Upload the `raw` image format file to s3 bucket with the command:

	aws s3 cp chess-rest-api-img.raw s3://com.uic.cs441.hw4.amrish/


![](https://bitbucket.org/ajhave5/amrishashvinkumar_jhaveri_hw4/raw/master/images/aws_osv_step3.png)


Step 4: Import the image uploaded in s3 bucket as a snapshot for EC2 using the command. 
`containers.json` is provided in the `qemu-images` folder. 
It has the format and the s3 bucket name and key details:

	
	aws ec2 import-snapshot --description "OSv Chess Rest API CS 441 Amrish" --disk-container "file://containers.json"


![](https://bitbucket.org/ajhave5/amrishashvinkumar_jhaveri_hw4/raw/master/images/aws_osv_step4.png)


Step 5: Create an AMI image from this snapshot:


![](https://bitbucket.org/ajhave5/amrishashvinkumar_jhaveri_hw4/raw/master/images/aws_osv_step5.png)


Step 6: Configure the image to have HAV(Hardware Assisted Virtualization), Storage as Magnetic disk.


![](https://bitbucket.org/ajhave5/amrishashvinkumar_jhaveri_hw4/raw/master/images/aws_osv_step6.png)


Step 7: Image will be available under AMI(Amazon Machine Image) on EC2 portal.


![](https://bitbucket.org/ajhave5/amrishashvinkumar_jhaveri_hw4/raw/master/images/aws_osv_step7.png)


Step 8: Launch an instance of this image with following configurations:

a) Select General Purpose t2.micro as the instance type for free tier:


![](https://bitbucket.org/ajhave5/amrishashvinkumar_jhaveri_hw4/raw/master/images/aws_osv_step8a.png)


b) Default config for Instance Config screen:


![](https://bitbucket.org/ajhave5/amrishashvinkumar_jhaveri_hw4/raw/master/images/aws_osv_step8b.png)


c) For storage change volume type to Magnetic(standard) for free tier:


![](https://bitbucket.org/ajhave5/amrishashvinkumar_jhaveri_hw4/raw/master/images/aws_osv_step8c.png)


d) Default config for Add Tags screen:


![](https://bitbucket.org/ajhave5/amrishashvinkumar_jhaveri_hw4/raw/master/images/aws_osv_step8d.png)


e) Default SSH inbound traffic is allowed, add additional rules so traffic on port 8000, 8081 is all allowed.


![](https://bitbucket.org/ajhave5/amrishashvinkumar_jhaveri_hw4/raw/master/images/aws_osv_step8e.png)


Review and Launch the instance.


Step 9: EC2 instance screen. Get the domain name provided on the screen.


![](https://bitbucket.org/ajhave5/amrishashvinkumar_jhaveri_hw4/raw/master/images/aws_osv_step8e.png)


Step 10: Hit the URL,` <ec2_domain_name>:8081/chess/newGame` from Postman as a POST request.


### Run Docker Image with the Spring App on Local Machine ###

You can directly run the docker container by pulling the docker image from the DockerHub with the command:

	sudo docker run -d -p "8081:8081" ajhave5/chess-hw4-amrish:latest

This should start the container and the Spring App inside it.
Using Postman with the url `localhost:8081/chess/newGame` and appropriate parameters as described above you should receive a valid response.
	

### Running Docker Image on AWS ECS ###

Step 1 : Open Get Started link of [AWS ECS](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-1#/firstRun)

Step 2: Create a custom Container definition: (Docker Image at [https://hub.docker.com/r/ajhave5/chess-hw4-amrish](https://hub.docker.com/r/ajhave5/chess-hw4-amrish) )
Provide Container name, docker-hub registry url of the image (registry.hub.docker.com/ajhave5/chess-hw4-amrish) 
and port mapping for port 8081.

![](https://bitbucket.org/ajhave5/amrishashvinkumar_jhaveri_hw4/raw/master/images/aws_ecs_docker_step2.png)

Step 3: Provide appropriate task name.

Step 4: On the Define your Service screen keep the default configuration (no load balancers)

![](https://bitbucket.org/ajhave5/amrishashvinkumar_jhaveri_hw4/raw/master/images/aws_ecs_docker_step4.png)

Step 5: Provide a cluster name.

Step 6: Review and launch.

![](https://bitbucket.org/ajhave5/amrishashvinkumar_jhaveri_hw4/raw/master/images/aws_ecs_docker_step6.png)


Using the domain-name or public ip-address you access the relevant REST APIS on port 8081.
